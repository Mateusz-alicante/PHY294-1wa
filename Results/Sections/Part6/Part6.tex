For the 405 nm excitation, the absorption edge was at $474.8 \pm 11.4 ~nm$, which corresponds to a band gap energy of $2.61 \pm 0.06 ~eV$. For the 500 nm excitation, the absorption edge was at $473.0 \pm 13.97~nm$, which corresponds to a band gap energy of $2.62 \pm 0.07 ~eV$. These two band gap energies are almost identical, which is expected since the band gap energy is a material property and should not depend on the excitation wavelength.

According to Professor Scott Ramsay of MSE160, a semiconductor is any material whose band gap exists and is smaller than $4~eV$. Thus, the yellow dye in this experiment is a semiconductor because the band gap is $2.61 ~eV$ which is smaller than that.
